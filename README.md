## About

I’m a student developer driven by curiosity and a strong desire to grow.

I enjoy building clean, scalable web applications while continuously learning how intelligent systems work under the hood. My current journey revolves around integrating AI into real-world applications, strengthening backend architecture, and understanding systems at a deeper level.

I believe growth comes from consistency, fundamentals, and hands-on building.
